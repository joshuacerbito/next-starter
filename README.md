# NextJS Starter Pack

This setup is bootstrapped using `create-next-app`, `tailwind`, and `storybook`.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone repo
2. `cd` into your repo then run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run these two commands on separate terminals:
   - `yarn dev` - This will start the NextJS dev server
   - `yarn storybook` - This will open the local Storybook server
